MicMare: Face Your Fears, Find Your Voice

Afraid of public speaking? Good. Let’s fix that.

MicMare is designed for people with public speaking anxiety who want to build confidence, calm their nerves, and practice under pressure—the worst kind of pressure.

You’ll face a cartoon crowd that scrolls, yawns, boos, throws tomatoes, and even walks out. Why? Because once you’ve survived that, real audiences will feel like a breeze.

How it works:

Spin the challenge wheel to get a surprise topic

Optional vocal warm-up to get your voice ready

Breathe through guided calming animations

Present to an intentionally rude audience

Replay your session and see your time, tone, and growth

MicMare makes practice uncomfortable on purpose—so you can get used to discomfort in a safe, low-stakes environment.

Every session helps you get better at thinking on your feet, managing anxiety, and realizing that public speaking isn't so scary after all.

If you can survive MicMare, you can speak anywhere.
